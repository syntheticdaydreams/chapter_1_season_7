An abstract narrative of a sentient AI love story told through fragmentary couplets and sonnets. Snippets of phone calls from the future. The end of the world, but that isn't the point. A sequence of puzzles and ciphers -- for the sake of more puzzles and ciphers. Inspired by 77 Days, ilovebees, Sappho, and the work of Sophie Calle. Not about you, but for you.

//Brief
synthetic daydreams is an ARG NFT collection that tells a romance at some point in the future. Conveyed through poetry and fragmentary text, accompanied by generated and human-made images, the collection hides clues and puzzles in embedded data, hex code, sound waves, Morse code, and seemingly unrelated Twitter accounts singing into the void. 

//Phase 1

*Scope*
- NFTs of images and poetry that conceal codes and clues. Holding these NFTs signals participation in the narrative-game, and each one holds only a part of the larger puzzle. 

- While each NFT can be appreciated for the art and poetry, those who want to know more can try and solve the inherent puzzles and gather information together.

- Launching a gated Discord with both in-world and out-of-character components. While those following the story can chat and share hints and solutions, there will be narrative-driven segments that will unlock upon certain criteria being met (a puzzle being solved, a message sent to the correct Twitter account, the proper phase of the moon, etc.)

- Season 1 will include X number of NFTs and clues, intended to be an introduction to the narrative and to enable holders to begin establishing what their identity is in the narrative world.

*Phase 1: Technicals and Roadmap*

- Creation of the artwork for the first run of NFTs

- Finalization of the poetry corpus

- Rough narrative and voice mapping from the team

- Initial set of puzzles- Creation of present and future-relevant Twitter 'actors'

- Discord set up


**07/2023 - Targeted Launch**

//Phase 2

*Scope*

- The story continues to evolve, with the releases of new NFTs -- including those created by partner artists that contain multitudes of clues.

- Direct work with artists will allow us to implement new kinds of clues and hidden elements that were not accessible in initial generative art. This can include embedded patterns, QR codes, text, and sound waves.

- Creation of antagonistic forces that seek to disrupt or intrude on the game

- Release of a concept album -- itself filled with clues and puzzles- Further media creations

*Phase 2: Technicals*

- More complexity in puzzles, including expanding to physical media and real world objects/interactions.

- Creation of simple AI agents to respond dynamically to text-based conversations
